# Meslo LG (Line Gap)

### A customized version of Apple's Menlo-Regular font (which is itself a customized version of Bitstream's Vera Sans Mono).

In Snow Leopard, Menlo-Regular is now the preferred default font
for Apple's developer tools and also the Terminal (unless you changed
the font settings yourself before upgrading to Snow Leopard, in
which case your changes will remain). I really like Menlo but I
have my gripes with it:

* The default vertical (line) spacing is just way too cramped
* I am not particularity fond of the horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk.

These issues are why I decided to customize Menlo. The tricky part
is keeping all the custom tables, hints, etc. intact when you adjust
the globally very affecting stuff that results in vertical spacing.

The LG in Meslo LG stands for Line Gap. The idea is to give the
user to have some control over vertical spacing by choosing one of
three line gap variants: small, medium and large (**Meslo LG S**,
**Meslo LG M** and **Meslo LG L** respectively). To learn more,
